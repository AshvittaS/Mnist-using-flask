# Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR)

A deep learning project for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset with a web-based interface.

## Unique Features

- **Pre-trained Neural Network**: Includes a pre-trained `mnist.h5` model for instant digit recognition without training overhead
- **Web Interface**: Interactive Flask-based application for real-time digit prediction
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple HTML interface for uploading handwritten digit images
- **MNIST Dataset Integration**: Trained on the classic MNIST dataset with high accuracy on handwritten digits (0-9)
- **Easy Deployment**: Ready-to-run application with minimal setup required

## Project Components

- **app.py**: Flask backend server handling digit recognition requests
- **mnist.h5**: Pre-trained Keras/TensorFlow model for digit classification
- **Mnist.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with model training and analysis pipeline
- **static/index.html**: Web interface for image upload and prediction display

## Getting Started

Run the Flask application to access the web interface and start recognizing handwritten digits.
